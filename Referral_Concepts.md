# Gin:
 - Gin framework is lightweight, well-documented, and, of course, extremely fast.
 - Gin is a microframework that doesnâ€™t come with a ton of fancy features out of the box. 
 - It only gives you the essential tools to build an API, such as routing, form validation, etc.
 - For tasks such as authenticating users, uploading files, and sending emails, you need to either install another third-party library or implement them yourself.
